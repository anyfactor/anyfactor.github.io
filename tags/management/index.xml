      <description>I am that weird guy who asks random questions to strangers. I recently had the opporunity to talk with a Japenese medium size business owner in a public transport. I always wanted to ask a question to a Japanese business owner, and I finally did.
Me: I understand the idea of &amp;ldquo;Japanese humbleness,&amp;rdquo; but waht if I don&amp;rsquo;t want to clean the toilet and the surrounding area.
He: Well, if all the employees are doing that, including the president, you should as well.
Me: I understand that, but if I am hired as an accountant and people have already cleaned the toilet 3 times, what is the value in this?</description>
