            </ul>

            <h2>
                Evaluation
            </h2>

            <p>
                My goal was to promote not only the services of the clinic but also educate inquiries made by
                professionals
                and handle communications.
            </p>

            <p>I identified the most crucial challenge and potential developement point very early one. The before and
                after
                treatment pictures. But the catch was the before pictures are <em>quite gnarly</em> to put in simple
                terms.
            </p>

            <p>Client has told me that the patients are suffering from a <em>stage 6 disease</em> and it is normal to
                them.
                But for the average person it is everything but normal.</p>

            <p>The client threw me the challenge to make the page seem like approachable for clients and layperson and
                be educational for the medical professionals.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>

            <h3>Caution Post with Album</h3>

            <p>This system allowed me to provide information of services with the before and after pictures by
                <em>softening the blow</em> a little bit and triggering a curiosity. I used the album feature of
                instagram to create a four picture information delivery mechanism. The technique and the description is
                the following - </p>

            <h4>First Picture: Desensitize and Entice</h4>

            <p>In the first picture I maintained the two step rule: Desensitize and Entice</p>

            <img src="./Cases/vein/1.png" class="case_img">

            <p><strong>Desensitize:</strong> don't want to in lack of a better word <em>disgust</em> people when they
                are scrolling past the feed. So, the first step for me was to blur the before picture.</p>

            <p><strong>Entice:</strong> As the picture itself is blurred out, I entice curiosity by letting viewers know
                what the album is about. And I more or less guide them to follow with my brightly colored text.</p>

            <h4>Second Picture: Before Picture</h4>

            <p><em>I have blurred out the before picture</em> but in the post original picture will be posted.</p>
            
            <img src="./Cases/vein/2.png" class="case_img">
            <p>I will use red obvious highlighter to to mark the vein deformity.</p>

            <p>(Not shown in picture) Use stickers to guide to see the after treatment pictures.</p>

            <h4>Third Picture: After Treatment Picture</h4>

            <p><em>Blurred out but in original it will be posted as is.</em></p>

            <img src="./Cases/vein/3.png" alt="" class="case_img">

            <p>Stickers will be used for both - </p>

            <ul><li>
                To go back see the before picture
            </li>
            <li>And to contact the clinic for appointment</li></ul>

            <h4>Fourth & Final Picture: Contact Information</h4>

            <img src="./Cases/vein/4.png" alt="" class="case_img">

            <p>In an obvious way show the contact and address. And option for DM for appointment (falls under my duties).</p>
