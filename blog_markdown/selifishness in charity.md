Title: Is helping others selfish?
Summary: We help others because we feel good about ourselves that we are helping others.

*From a reddit discussion I had*

I think every decision we make is selfish to the point that we either convince ourselves to that or it is our base response or subconscious to do us.

Even philanthropic work falls under this category which is by nature THE selfless act. We in our process to help others would convince ourselves that this is the best thing to do for them. Even we rarely ask what would you want "me" to do, never we ask what needs to be done.

Charity or any other form of help is often never anonymously which is just surface level. The intention to help others isn't calculated objectively, selfless and with an unbiased perception. We help because we feel good about ourselves. We are never tasked with great sacrifice when it comes to being selfless generous. Even when religious figures help people allegedly selflessly they are doing that for them to be closer to their god of choice.

**Clarification:** I am not against the idea of helping others. I am merely deconstructing the idea of help and selfishness from a pure (aka theoretical) linguistic definition.

>If I help some one simply cause I want to, can you prove that I did it for the desire to feel good about myself, or is simply more likely that I wanted to help some for no other reason then I wanted to, and seeing them happy makes myself happy in turn, and that’s the reason why I decided to help.

If we talk about the visibility of intention then the point of charity is moot. As we can never come to the conclusion of what triggers any action. Inherent intention can never be exposed and can be justified absolutely on a scale of selflessness. I am not inside anyone's brain so I don't what they are thinking, so this whole view is very very theoretical. 

> seeing them happy makes myself happy

In an "absolute" (I know that word is stupid) term there is no first-person pronoun in help. Your intention or your opinion shouldn't be involved in help because now "you" are involved in the case of charity itself. You wouldn't partake in any help where you are not absolutely satisfied yourself or you don't get a hit of dopamine of moral superiority. You are imagining that your act itself is the best possible recourse that will help the other person.

A non-conventional/shallower example of this would motivational quotes or bible verses that people post on Facebook. They are thinking these messages will help others, but in fact these messages are mass-produced filler material for social media circulation that almost never triggers a sense of motivation or whatever your intended reason for sharing that is. But the idea of sharing is that I am helping others by sharing the message but in reality, it is through my message they are being helped. The message, the container of help if you will, itself is worthless

I understand what you are saying but I would argue that nobody in absolute term tries to help others unless there is some sort of pleasure system of self-righteousness involved.

I could argue that every great person that died sacrificed a great deal for the sake of mankind worked towards an ideology where his dedication was rewarded with that person feeling they are right.

> I don't believe in higher deities or some real life karma point system. I believe in my values. And the feeling good part is a scam. I even end up hating myself more, because I could never do enough.

What if I say there is a universal moral code that goes against everything you believe in? This moral standard can never be established people have individual goals and ideologies themselves.

Religious groups often oppose progressive ideas yet you can't say they are not charitable. They are charitable yet they hold an ideology as fundamental. On the other hand, progressive charity can result in "think of the children"ism.

If you are donating to a homeless person you are doing that for yourself, you are not absolutely thinking the best thing to do would be. You are never going to go for an act that doesn't give you the pleasure of you being right even though it might be the best thing to do for them or the society (which is just another can of worms).

Even when we are giving to people we abide by a fundamental ideology that we hold foundational to our entire being. And catering to that ideology can in my opinion be selfish because you are now happy that you are right because of how you help.

> Calm down, Ayn Rand!


Well, my argument is the opposite of neurotic self-interest will bring about good.

I think in charity the more your remove your self the better help you are bringing but the idea of self can never remove but only be minimized. Which is foundational to anti-Randian thinking. But it's also anti-Marxist, which another argument.

Never mentioned "purely". But yes, there is an idea of selfishness.

As a third world poverty/development theory armchair expert, I would say often times when it comes to foreigners directly involving themselves in charitable actions like these, the security cost, communication cost, transportation costs, medical costs, accommodation costs and other additional costs in aggregate can "sometimes" far exceed the utility of the charitable action itself than to have the work done by the locals by only supporting them with material and knowledge resources.

Again I was explicit with the word "sometimes". UNICEF and USAID have made a significant contribution to the education of highly impoverished families by making cartoons that were broadcasted through all-access public television. You have no idea how much these cartoons have contributed to improving complex development issues such as child marriage, clean water, sanitation, education, gender equality, vaccination etc one episode at a time.

I could argue that in that scenario it could be more "personally fulfilling" to fly out to those countries and teaching these children's with an aid of a translator and without education in teaching but in the long run oftentimes, there are better solutions that are cheap and less fulfilling like the cartoons I mentioned or the food for education programmes.

You might die of malaria because of this noble act. But the people making the cartoon barely get any name recognition. Heck, UNICEF and USAID's name get mentioned at the end of the credit sequence. So, does selflessness means the greatest charity the answer you tell me. You might think you are being selfless because you are dying of malaria, but the cartoonist who may or may not took a salary cut to make that video have has no/minimal self in the charity itself.

Again sorry. This isn't fun for me either.
