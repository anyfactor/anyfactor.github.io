        Hi, I am anyfactor. I am a masters student in Accounting & Information
        Systems, and I dabble in python scripting and web development. I am a
        fast learner, and a smart worker willing to learn and apply myself in
        challenging yet high-growth opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core interests are in Automation, Data Analytics and Web Development.
        But aside from continueing professional development in Full Stack Web
        Development, Data Science, Data Visualization, Web Service Automation, I
        am trying expand my "knawledge" by learning CRM software development,
        and UI tools for mobile applications. Because of my business degree, I
        am also very comfortable in performing as a business associate.

        <p>
          Being a self taught coder most of my training came from watching
          youtube tutorials, reading documentations and books, and problem
          solving in stackoverflow.
          
          <p>A detailed breakdown of training in individual languages and other stuff can be <a href="#">found here.</a></p>
          My experience, and training in coding can
          also be traced back to interactive tutorial websites and my various

        <h2>Projects & Skillz</h2>
        <h3>Automation & Web Scraping</h3>
        <p>
          For automation and web scraping I mainly use python. The modules I
          work with most are-
        </p>
        <ul>

        <h3>Data Analytics, Statistics & Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>
          For data application I primarily use Microsoft Excel (because I am an
          accounting student), but I am comfortable with a number of statistical
          software and various python modules.
        </p>
        <strong>Softwares -</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
          <li>Stata</li>
          <li>Eviews</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Python Modules -</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Pandas</li>
          <li>Matplotlib</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For Visualization I am comfortable using Excel and Adobe photoshop.
          But I am planning to learn -
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dash</li>
          <li>Seaborn</li>
          <li>D3.js (Javascript)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I am hoping to learn more about data science and machine learning
          particularly through the use of the tensorflow library. Being an
          business grad, I have an active interest in FinTech, and my skills and
          education are very much suitable for active stock market trading,
          handling portfolios and algotrading.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          I have not practiced web development for a very long time, but I am
          looking forward to give it another shot. My project section is
          non-existent but I will try to add stuff on my
          <a href="https://github.com/anyfactor">Github</a> and
          <a href="https://codepen.io/anyfactor/">Codepen. </a>
        </p>
        <strong>The skills -</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Vanilla Javascript</li>
          <li>Django, Node.js</li>
          <li>Sqlite, Mysql</li>
          <li>Github pages</li>
        </ul>
        I am currently learning a number of things in relation to web
        development, primarily the stuff on my
        <a href="https://www.learn.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>
        curriculum. But in addition to those I am also learning -
        <ul>
          <li>React.js</li>
          <li>Postgrsql</li>
          <li>Random Javascript Frameworks</li>
          <li>D3.js (Data Visualization)</li>
          <li>Firebase</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other stuff</h3>
        <h4>
          Microsoft Excel | Data cleanup, Accounting, Statistical Analysis
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have been an active user of Microsoft Excel for quite a long time,
          because it is the bread and butter of accounting. I realized quickly
          for office applications prowess in Excel is a valuable thing to have.
          I think I am comfortable in describing myself as an "intermediate"
          level Excel user because of my knowledge in a wide variety of
          functions and their appropriate applications, and my basic
          understanding of VBA and designing macros.
        </p>
        <h4>Content Summarizing and Simplification</h4>
        <p>I have a gift which I call is simplifying things to to an "ELI10" (Explain Like I am 10). I will go through various types of media, and extract the gist of the idea and create easy to understand examples to make connections with the topic. Check out my <a href="https://medium.com/@anyfactor">medium blog to learn more.</a></p>

        <h4>Mobile Application development | Flutter, Java</h4>
        <p>
          For mobile application development I am thinking about learning
          Flutter, google's corss-platform UI/UX tool for smartphone application
          development. I am currently learning Java to understand mobile and
          software development particularly CRM software development like
          Salesforce.
        </p>
        <h4>
          CRM and Accounting Softwares | Salesforce, Force.com, Quickbooks
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think there is a huge potential in app development in the CRM and
          bookkeeping software market. For Salesforce, I am trying to get
          started with salesforce administration than eventually move to
          salesforce developer position. For this path I am going through
          <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/me/0052J000008Y26PQAS"
            >Trailheads (Salesforce's Interactive Learning Platform)</a
          >
          and learning Java as it helps to pickup Salesforce's application
          development language Apex more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          For QuickBooks and similiar online bookkeeping systems, the mechanism
          and workflow where taught us in my undergrad program. The advantage of
          these software being web application can be exploited through my
          automation and web development skills.
        </p>
        <h4>Amazon Fulfillment Store</h4>
        <p>
          I assisted in developing efficient workflow and algorithmic process
          pattern to assist and manage a medium sized amazon store from end to
          end supply chain.
        </p>
        <h4>Stock Trading</h4>
        <p>
          I had previously designed algorithmic worflow to trade in stock
          simulations based on information gathered from finance.yahoo.com. The
          process was-
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard investment decisions (minimum programming complexity) based
          on-

          <li>Statistics</li>
          <li>Financials</li>
          <li>Holders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I wish to design algorthim and progarms for Specualtive Investment
          Decisions (moderate programming complexity)
        </p>
