        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the <a href="hiring.html#other">Passive Social Media Management</a> Service</h3>

        <h4>Why no credential</h4>
        <p>
            You get what you pay for. In this service, I am getting less $5 an hour and you will be getting a service
            that is close to that value.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you see my other <a href="hiring.html" services></a> you can see that I am asking for much more then what
            I am asking here
            and it is backed by experience and some credentials. I am not a professional marketing consultant but I am a
            passive social media manager. I will not reach goals for you, but I will maintain your social and eCommerce
            platform based on your instructions.
        </p>

        <h4>
            What is your experience/ Who are past your clients / Show me your portfolio
        </h4>

        <p>
            I have managed a couple of social media accounts before but nobody wants to tell the world they got their
            work done by $4-$5 an hour. And in those jobs, I had to impersonate the owner rather than the brand itself.
            I respect their wish to maintain their secrecy. But for this service, for your and my convenience, consider
            that I don't have any experience.
        </p>

        <h4>
            How fast can you grow my brand / What is your customer acquisition plan / Define your marketing strategy
        </h4>

        <p>
            The keywords for the service are -
            <ol>
                <li>Passive</li>
                <li>$5 an Hour</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p> I think that achieving goals and setting up strategies
            are requirements that go beyond the service offering. I will only work based on your instructions and will
            try to do whatever you were doing. </p>
        <p> Sure, we can
            <ol>
                <li>Brainstorm Ideas</li>
                <li>Analyze Customer Reaction & Comments</li>
                <li>Analyze Competition</li>
                <li>Review News Material</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            But I hope you do realize setting up goals and strategies require a much more active role at much more
            higher price.

        <h4>How would you respond appropriately to customer inquiries</h4>

        <p>
            I have an inherent talent to emphasize well with people, I think.

            After being hired I will try to understand the brand and your vision. In the beginning, I will ask you to
            review my answers over chat. Then I will start replying to the frequently asked questions more easily.

            For the questions that I don't know the answer to I will curate and communicate that with you over
            chat and respond.

            You don't have to tell me what exactly to write, you will just need to give me your vision. That's all.
